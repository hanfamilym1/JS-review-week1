/*
  Managers for Widget Co. get promoted when they get more employees, and get a bonus when they fire employees.
  Progressive Managers have all the same properties as the manager,
  but they also have the following additional properties:
    - title - default 'Not a manager'
    - bonus - default 0

  When employees are added or removed we need to check and update their title. Their titles are as follows:
    0 : Not a manager
    1-3 : Barely Manager
    4-10 : Mostly Manager
    11-50 : Manager
    51-100 : Manager Plus
    101+ : Bestest Manager

  Everytime they fire an employee they get $100 added to their bonus.

  Call your new class ProgressiveManager

//Code Here

class ProgressiveManager {
    constructor(title, bonus){
        this.title = 'Not a manager'
        this.bonus = 0

    Widget Co has a factory that makes widgets.
    Factories have Machines.
  
    Make a Machine class that takes in no parameters
    A Machine has the following properties:
      - widgets_made_count - default 0
      - wear_and_tear_count - default 0
      - needs_reboot - default false
  
    A Machine has the following methods:
      - makeWidgets
          - This function takes in a number and increases widgets_made_count by that amount
          - It also increases wear_and_tear_count by 1 for every 50
      - fixMachine
          - This function sets needs_reboot to true
      - reboot
          - This function returns a function that is called when the machine is done rebooting
          - It should set decrease wear_and_tear_count by 10, and set needs_reboot to false
